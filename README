TODO:
  - Implement main screen
  	* Fling capable coaster. Bounces off of top and bottom
  	* Basically a title screen with group name and our names
  	* Shake to load random page
  	
  - Implement orientation
  	* Use orientation sensor and accelerometer to post back angles and, well, orientation
  	
  - Implement pouring interface with Animation
  	* Possible game per Rader? Is it possible to pour quicker but maintain the proper drink?
  		- Too much or too little head could result in loss
    * Champagne
    * Soda
    * Beer
    
  - Implement mapping functionality
  	* Use geographic location and overlay to map closest breweries
  	* Allow user to pinch and zoom
  	* Show breweries only within 50 mile radius (for memory purposes, don't even know if API will support this many)
  	* If there is time: Click the icon to pull up the information (via Google or whatever)
  		-- Use integrated browser and just load new intent this way
